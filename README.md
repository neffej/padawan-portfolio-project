# padawan-portfolio-project

## Description

For this project, I wrote the HTML and CSS for my own sample professional portfolio. I wrote these files from scratch, and I will add to this website and update its codebase as I deploy more projects and become more knowledgeable about HTML and CSS.

## Tasks Completed

-The website has a header, body and footer section.
-- The header has an integrated navigation bar with links to the other sections of the webpagei
--The body includes a banner image, an About Me section, and a gallery of deployed web applications.
--The images in the gallery are clickable links
--The footer includes links to several ways to contact me
-The website is responsive to sizing and can be viewed on mobile devices
-There is a hover effect on the navbar links
-At present, the projects in the Published Works section are placeholder images and links. 
-When I develop and deploy more web applications, I will update the placeholders to live websites
